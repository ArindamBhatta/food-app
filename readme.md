# Food Delivery App

A scalable, modular, and maintainable food delivery backend built with Node.js, TypeScript, Express, and MongoDB, following the Clean Architecture pattern.

## Overview

This project is a backend API for a food delivery platform supporting customers, vendors, food management, orders, authentication, and more. It is designed for clarity, testability, and easy extension.

## Features

- User authentication (JWT, OTP)
- Customer and vendor management
- Food catalog and cart
- Order placement and tracking
- Cloud image upload
- Role-based access
- Modular, testable codebase

## Clean Architecture

The codebase is organized in layers to enforce separation of concerns:

- **Entities**: Core business models (e.g., Customer, Vendor, Food, Order)
- **Repositories**: Database access
- **Services**: Business logic
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests/responses
- **DTOs**: Data transfer objects, for request/response validation.
- **Infrastructure**: External dependencies (database, logger, cache)

## Tech Stack

- Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js
- MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)
- Cloudinary (image upload)
- JWT authentication
- Winston logger
